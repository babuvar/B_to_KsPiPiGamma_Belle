+-------------------------------------------+

combined version with evtgen package (A. Zupanc)   2010.05.12      Y. Horii

                Usage:

                1) ./runGsimReco.csh [absolutePathToEvtgenMdstFiles/]
                
                2) ./makeSummaryGsim -MC log/*.log   and
                   ./check_log.csh
                   (for the check of the log foles)

                This version includes makeSummaryGsim,
                while allot.pl and nBB.txt has been removed
                for the correspondence to evtgen package by A. Zupanc.

version 1.6.1   2010.03.23      Y. Horii (suggested from K. Trabelsi, help from A. Zupanc)

                The file "runGsimReco.csh" is included in the package.
                This script will be helpful to obtain the MC
                with exp-dependent (not run-dependent) values of beam energy.
                Please check the explanations prepared by A. Zupanc at Wiki.

                The file "check_log.csh" is added for the check of quality of output (log).
                For the usage, please see the upper part in "check_log.csh".

version 1.6.0   2010.02.08      Y. Horii

		${PREF}r000237-r000243_bbg.bbs \
		removed from .addbgrc (thanks, Christoph)

version 1.3	2006.11.03	Y. Ushiroda
		basf/mcprod5-e45{a,b}.basf modified (thanks, Christoph)

version 1.2	2006.10.13	Y. Ushiroda
		basf/mcprod5-e19{a,b}.basf modified (thanks, Adam)

version 1.1	2006.10.12	Y. Ushiroda
		basf/mcprod5-e41{a,b}.basf added (thanks, Sasa)

version 1.0	2006.10.10	Y. Ushiroda
		basf, gsim files renewed by T. Higuchi, thanks!
		works on new B comp with i386 lib.


ushrec.tgz contains the following files:
 README			this file
 .addbgrc		set ADDBG related environment variable
 rec.csh		run script to be submitted
 gsim/gsim.*.dat	exp dependent gsim data file
 basf/*.basf		exp dependent part of basf script
 nBB.txt		exp dependent no. of BB events
 allot.pl		generates list of jobs to be submitted
 mdst, log, hbook       directories of the location of the outputs


----------------------------
     What you should do     
----------------------------
1. prepare hundreds of generator files with different seed files.
   Now, B computer (as well as Afarm2) can be used for the generation.

2. ./allot.pl [your generator files]
   You can use '*' as wildcard to specify generator files
   You will then obtain a text file named 'submitter00' (00 may be 01, 02,...)

3. Check the content of the submitter file
   It should look like
   bsub -q a ./rec.csh gen/file/you/specified/0 35 9
   bsub -q a ./rec.csh gen/file/you/specified/1 35 10
   ...

4. Try the first line of the submitter file if it runs okay.

5. comment out the first line with '#' and
   % source submitter00
   to submit all the rest (if you wish)




---------------------------
     For newer exp.
---------------------------
.addbgrc
nBB.txt
gsim/
basf/
rec.csh
must be updated



---------------------------
     known problem
---------------------------
This is to generate a complete set of MC files upto a certain exp number.
Not suitable to top up.
