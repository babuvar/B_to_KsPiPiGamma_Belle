This is a package for run-independent MC production.

For Upsilon(4S), the exp-dependent values of beam energies are used in EvtGen,
and corresponding exp-dependent simulations can be done.

For Upsilon(5S), a fixed value of beam energy is used in EvtGen,
and exp-dependent simulation can be done by adding files and lines
in gsim/basf, gsim/gsim, and gsim/.addbgrc.

Please go to evtgen directory first, and see README file.
After the event generations, go to gsim directory and see README file.

The base is made by Y. Ushiroda and A. Zupanc.
