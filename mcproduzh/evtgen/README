Version: 1.1
Date   : 27/03/2010
***************************

Changes since version 1.0:
- bug reported and fixed by Marko Bracko. Thanks Marko!
  - script could start a job with 0 as number of events to be generated
  - it turns out that BASF interprets 0 as 'generate events until infinity'
  - this is avoided since version 1.1

This file describes the content and usage of automatic script for evtgen 
generator file production. 

Content:
* README  - this file

* nBB.txt - input file that holds the experiment number and its corresponding
            luminosity for which the evtgen generator files will be produced
            It is taken from Ushiroda-san's/Horii-san's gsim+reco tools (version 1.6.0)
            you can use # to comment the input line

* bzerodplusdminus.dec - example decay table file for the
                         e-e+  -> Y(4S) -> B0 B0bar process
                         B0    -> D+ D- 
			 B0bar -> generic decay
                         D+    -> K- pi+ pi+
                         D+    -> K0s pi+
			 (charge conjugation is implied)

* bszerodsplusdsminus.dec - example decay table file for the
                            e-e+ -> Y(5S) -> Bs* Bs*bar
			    Bs*  -> Bs0 gamma
                            Bs0  -> Ds- Ds+
                            Ds+  -> K+ K- pi+
                            (charge conjugation is implied)

* d0kk.dec - example decay table file for the
             e-e+ -> vpho -> c cbar -> D*+ X
             D*+  -> D0 pi+
             D0   -> K+ K-
             (charge conjugation is NOT implied)

* Y4S.conf - evtgen module parameters configuration file
             since default values are set to the values for Upsilon(4S) process
             nothing has to be done

* Y5S.conf - evtgen module parameters configuration file for Upsilon(5S) process
             sets the ROOT_PARTICLE to Upsilon(5S)

* vpho.conf - to generate e+e- -> vpho ->

* vpho-withskimming.conf - evtgen module parameters configuration file for e-e+ -> c cbar -> D*+ X
                           sets the ROOT_PARTICLE to vpho and INCLUSIVE_PARTICLE to D*+ 
                           c.c. is also saved (INCLUSIVE_MODE=2)

* createEvtgenBASFscript.csh - this script is executed in runEvtgen script. It produces evtgen
                               BASF script.

* runEvtgen - script that submites jobs to "a" queu. One job per experiment, if the number of events
              in job dosn't exceed the EventsPerJobLimi. In case it does, more jobs per experiment
              will be submitted.

              The usage is: 

./runEvtgen nBB.txt [decaytablefile.dec] [evtgenModuleParamatersConfigFile] [TotalNomberOfEvents] [EventsPerJob]

[TotalNumberOfEvents] : the total number of events you whish to generate
                        script will calculate according to nBB.txt input how many events should
                        be generated for each experiment according to its luminosity

[EventsPerJob] : maximal number of events to be generated in one job
                 

Output:
 - submitted BASF scripts 
 - log files (in log directory)
 - generator files (in mdst directory)
